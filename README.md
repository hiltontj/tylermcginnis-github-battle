# Tyler McGinnis's React Course

This is the working repo that I am using for the React course from [tylermcginnis.com](https://tylermcginnis.com/).

##Setup

You will need to [create a new GitHub OAuth app](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/), and create your `app-config.json` file in the root project folder. There is a template for `app-config.json` provided in this repo. The actual config file is ignored by git.
